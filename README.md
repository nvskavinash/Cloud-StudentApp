# Cloud-StudentApp
1)This is a Student app which works as follows <br>
2)The user will be seeing the login page first<br>
3)If the user is not present in the database he/she would be redirected to the singup page where the user will be able to save his/her username, password, firstname, lastname, email address and would be able to upload a text or a pdf file.
4)After that he/she would be redirected to a page where he/she will be able to see all his/her details along with a link to download his/her's uploaded file and the wordcount of that. 
5)If the user already exists in the database he would be directly shown his details along with a link to download his/her's uploaded file and the wordcount of that.
6)If the user entered wrong credentials, he/she would be displayed with invalid credentials.
7)Note that the file name is stored in our machine with the name "file_" appended with the username to avoid contradiction.
